1. Create inventory so that you do not have to put list of servers inside each playbook
    1. *Note inventory does not work when running ping tests
    2. Vi inventory.txt
        1. Put target hosts into inventory file like below
            1. target ansible_host=<target private ip>
            2. Ex:target ansible_host=172.31.40.80
				target ansible_host=172.31.37.89
